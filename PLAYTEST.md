# Baby Driver - Manual Playtest Checklist

## Purpose
This document provides a manual test checklist for verifying the Baby Driver game functionality before release.

## Test Environment
- **Date:** 2025-10-19
- **Tester:** Copilot Coding Agent (Automated Testing)
- **Browser:** Playwright/Chromium

- **DevicePixelRatio:** 1

## Pre-Test Setup
1. [x] Open `index.html` in a web browser
2. [x] Open browser console (F12) to check for errors
3. [x] Verify no console errors on page load

## Visual/Layout Tests

### Desktop (Chrome/Firefox/Safari)
- [x] Page loads without scrollbars
- [x] Canvas fills viewport appropriately
- [x] UI elements (header, score, controls) are visible

- [x] Help icon (?) is visible in top-right corner
- [x] On-screen touch controls appear (enabled by default)

### Mobile/Tablet (iOS Safari, Android Chrome)
- [ ] Page scales correctly to device screen
- [ ] No horizontal scrolling
- [ ] Canvas is appropriately sized
- [ ] Touch controls overlay is visible and positioned well
- [ ] All UI elements remain accessible

- [ ] Game continues to function after resize
- [ ] DevicePixelRatio scaling works (check on Retina/high-DPI display)

## Control Tests

### Keyboard Controls (Desktop)
- [ ] Arrow Up: Car accelerates
- [ ] Arrow Down: Car brakes/decelerates
- [ ] Arrow Left: Car moves to left lane (with proper warning if no blinker)
- [ ] Arrow Right: Car moves to right lane (with proper warning if no blinker)
- [ ] Q key: Left blinker activates
- [ ] E key: Right blinker activates
- [ ] W key: Blinkers turn off

### Touch Controls (Mobile/Desktop)

- [ ] Road edges clearly marked

## Asset Loading Tests
- [ ] On high-DPI display (devicePixelRatio >= 2): Check console for highres asset attempts
- [ ] On standard display: Fallback assets load correctly
- [ ] No broken images or missing assets
- [ ] Asset loading doesn't block game start

## Tutorial/Help Tests
- [ ] Tutorial modal shows on first visit
- [ ] Tutorial content is readable and formatted correctly

- [ ] Memory usage stays reasonable (check browser DevTools)
- [ ] No memory leaks after extended play (10+ minutes)

## Error Handling Tests
